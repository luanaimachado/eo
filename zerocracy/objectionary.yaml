  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points for
    this: -20 as a basis. Next time, create a new branch, push your changes over there,
    then make a pull request and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing
    via pull requests is a [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html). '

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/eo, the penalty amount is -20.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is +197. '

    can boost your score next time. Keep the code coming – quality and quantity both

    the reward amount is 5.
  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Great job on your contribution! You've earned +5
    points, which is pretty cool considering the scale of your code (5239 hits-of-code!).
    While we love seeing big changes, remember that [keeping things concise](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    can be super helpful. We noticed only 3 comments on the review – more feedback
    can really boost the quality. Don't worry though, you're still rocking a [+165](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html)
    balance! Keep those contributions coming, and let's aim for that sweet spot of
    code size and review engagement next time. You've got this! \U0001F4AA"

  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F60A Heads up about your branch name \"`fix-build`\"
    - it's [not the best practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html)
    for Git. According to our policy, that's a -10 point hit. For future reference,
    try naming your branch after the ticket number you're working on, like \"`43`\".
    It'll make things clearer for everyone. Your current balance is [+18](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).

  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -20 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [+295](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). '

  greeting: "Hey there, awesome job on your contribution! \U0001F389 You've snagged
    +18 points this time: +25 for the base reward, but we had to dock -7 because your
    [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html) (643) crossed
    the 200 mark. Don't sweat it though – it's still a solid effort! Remember, we
    love contributions under 200 HOC, but we're thrilled you're putting in the work.
    Your balance is now sitting pretty at [+105](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Keep those contributions rolling in, and let's aim for that sweet spot of concise,
    impactful code. [Keep up](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    the great work!"

  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Nice work on your contribution! You've snagged
    +5 points this time. Here's the breakdown: +25 base points, -15 because we missed
    out on a code review (let's aim for that next time!), and -5 due to only having
    2 comments (we're shooting for at least 5). Remember, more [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)
    can boost your points, and getting those reviews in is crucial. [Keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    the code coming! Your current balance is [+176](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Let's see if we can hit that 80-point max on your next contribution! \U0001F4AA"

  greeting: 'Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your effort in writing
    154 hits-of-code, which earned you +7 points. However, there are some areas for
    improvement: the lack of code review (-15 points) and no comments from reviewers
    (-10 points) are concerns. As per our policy, you''ve received +20 points as a
    base reward. Your total for this contribution is +5 points (adjusted to meet our
    minimum). Your running balance is now [+38](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    We encourage you to engage in the review process and [continue contributing](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html).
    Let''s work together to enhance both quality and collaboration!'

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/hone-maven-plugin, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [+243](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). '

  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Thanks for your contribution, but it looks like
    we've got some room for improvement. You've earned +4 points, but here's the breakdown:
    +4 base points, -16 for no code review (ouch!), -4 for only 2 comments (we need
    more feedback!), and -8 for just 5 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)
    (aim for at least 20 next time). We added +28 to keep you motivated. Remember,
    code reviews and comments are crucial, and we love to see more substantial contributions!
    [Keep them coming](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html),
    and let's aim for that 24-point max next time! Your current balance is [+205](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).

  details: It's time to punish @Anatolay for the branch named as 'extended', which
    is wrong in objectionary/proof#47, the penalty amount is -12.
  greeting: It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html)
    to name Git branches like \"`extended`\". As per our policy, this violates the
    naming convention and incurs a **-12 point** penalty. For future reference, name
    your branch after the ticket number you're working on, e.g., \"`46`\". This helps
    maintain consistency and clarity in our workflow. Your current balance stands
    at [+33](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).

    the reward amount is 4.
  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Thanks for your contribution, but it looks like
    we hit a few snags. Your 1094 hits-of-code were impressive, but a bit too much
    (we aim for under 200). We missed out on a code review, which is crucial, and
    only got 2 comments - we usually hope for at least 6. Despite these hiccups, you've
    still earned 4 points (our minimum reward). Keep in mind, smaller, focused contributions
    with thorough reviews tend to earn more. Your balance is now [+152](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Let's keep the momentum going - looking forward to your next [contribution](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)!"

  commit: 5a3b8ce0c78058703d06f0b9e998833a6293c7fe
  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/eo, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [+188](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). '

  details: It's time to punish @Anatolay for the branch named as 'fix-links', which
    is wrong in objectionary/proof#50, the penalty amount is -12.
  greeting: It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html)
    to name Git branches like \"`fix-links`\". As per our policy, this violation incurs
    a **-12** point penalty. Remember, branch names should match the ticket number
    you're working on. For instance, \"`49`\" would be ideal here. Your current balance
    stands at [-2](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). Let's
    adhere to conventions to maintain code clarity and avoid future penalties.

  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Nice work on your contribution! You've earned +4
    points, but there's room for improvement. The 295 hits-of-code was a bit high
    (over 200), and we missed out on a code review. Only 2 comments came in, which
    is below the 6 we aim for. Don't worry though, we've adjusted it to give you something
    for your efforts. Keep the [contributions](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    coming, but remember: smaller chunks, more reviews, and encourage those comments!
    Your balance is now [+154](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Let's aim higher next time! \U0001F4AA"

  details: It's time to punish @eyihluyc for the branch named as 'update-toolchain',
    which is wrong in objectionary/proof#51, the penalty amount is -12.
  greeting: As per our [policy](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html),
    naming Git branches like \"`update-toolchain`\" isn't recommended and incurs a
    **-12 point** penalty. For better practices, name your branch after the ticket
    number you're addressing, such as \"`50`\". This ensures clarity and consistency.
    Your current balance stands at [+4](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Let's aim for improvement in future branch naming.

    for this one. Here's the breakdown: 4 points as a base, plus a sweet 8 points
    for reviewing a whopping 895 hits-of-code! We had to deduct 10 points because
    there were only 4 comments (the policy aims for at least 6), but we added 1 point
    to keep things positive. Remember, more comments can boost your points next time!
    Your current balance sits at [-64](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Keep up the great work, and let's aim for even more engaging reviews in the future!"

  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B Thanks for your review! You've earned +4 points,
    which is the minimum according to our policy. We had to deduct some points because
    there was only 1 comment (we aim for at least 6), but we made sure you got something
    for your effort. Remember, more comments can boost your points up to +8! Your
    current balance is [-16](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Keep up the good work and let's aim for more detailed reviews next time! \U0001F4AA"

  greeting: |-
    Thanks for your contribution! Here's your reward breakdown: +4 base points, -8 for exceeding 200 hits-of-code (1752), -16 for surpassing 800 hits-of-code, -16 for missing code review, -4 for only 2 comments, +44 adjustment to meet minimum. Total: +4 points. While the code volume is impressive, remember our policy values [quality over quantity](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html). Future contributions could earn more by adhering to size limits and engaging in thorough code reviews. Your balance is now [+119](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). Keep improving!

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -8 for too many hits-of-code (1752 >= 200); -16 for way too many hits-of-code (1752 >= 800); -16 for the lack of code review; -4 for very few (2) comments; +44 to give you at least something. Please, [keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) them coming. Your running balance is [+119](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).  -->

    forget the code review. Keep the [quality](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)

    (you had 663), -16 for missing code review, and -4 for only having 2 comments.

    and comments are crucial! Try to [keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    your contributions under 200 hits-of-code for maximum points. Your current balance

  greeting: |-
    Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your effort, but there are some areas for improvement. Your submission earned +4 points as a base reward, but we had to deduct points due to the following: -8 for exceeding the recommended hits-of-code (260 ≥ 200), -16 for lacking a code review, and -4 for having only 2 comments. However, we've adjusted the total to ensure you receive at least the minimum reward. Your final point allocation is +4. We encourage you to [focus on quality](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) in future contributions. Keep up the good work! Your current balance stands at [+93](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution!

  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/eo, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).

  greeting: |-
    Thanks for your contribution! Your effort is appreciated, but there's room for improvement. Here's the breakdown: +4 base points, -8 for 783 hits-of-code (exceeding 200), -16 for missing code review, and +24 to meet the minimum reward. Remember, our [policy](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) values quality over quantity. Aim for smaller, focused contributions and ensure code reviews for better rewards. Your current balance is [+109](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). Keep refining your approach!

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -8 for too many hits-of-code (783 >= 200); -16 for the lack of code review; +24 to give you at least something. Please, [keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) them coming. Your running balance is [+109](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).  -->

  branch: rel
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for the branch named as 'rel', which is wrong
    in objectionary/eo#3390, the penalty amount is -12.
  greeting: "Hey there! \U0001F44B I noticed you named your branch \"`rel`\" - not
    quite following our naming convention. Remember, we're supposed to use ticket
    numbers for branch names (like \"`3389`\" in this case). [Our guidelines](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html)
    explain why this is important. As per our policy, there's a -12 point penalty
    for non-compliant names. This brings your balance to [-43](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Let's aim for better naming next time to avoid penalties and keep our workflow
    smooth! \U0001F680\n\n<!-- It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html)
    to name Git branches the way you named this one: \"`rel`\". You've earned -12
    points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of the
    ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for example, would
    be \"`3389`\". Your running balance is [-43](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).

  greeting: |-
    Thank you for your contribution! Here's the breakdown of your points: +4 base points, -16 for no code review, and -4 for only 2 comments. However, we've adjusted it to +4 to meet our minimum reward. While we appreciate your effort, please ensure future contributions include code reviews and more substantial feedback. Your [running balance](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html) is now +105. Remember, [quality and speed](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) are both important. Keep up the good work and we look forward to your next contribution!

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -16 for the lack of code review; -4 for very few (2) comments; +20 to give you at least something. Please, [keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) them coming. Your running balance is [+105](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).  -->

    you wrote 1808 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html),

    points for the code review or comments since there weren't any. But don't worry,
    we've still got you covered with 4 points! Remember, [quality over quantity](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    is key. Keep the contributions coming, but maybe aim for smaller, more focused
    chunks next time. Your balance is now at [+100](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Looking forward to your next contribution! \U0001F680\n\n<!-- Thanks for the contribution!

  greeting: "Hey there, coding superstar! \U0001F468‍\U0001F4BB Thanks for your hard
    work on this contribution! Let's break down your reward: You started with 4 points,
    but those 973 hits-of-code were a bit much (we aim for under 200). The 4 comments
    were helpful, but we'd love to see more next time - at least 6 would be great!
    To keep you motivated, we bumped you up to 4 points (our minimum reward). Keep
    those contributions [coming](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html),
    but remember: quality over quantity! Your current balance is [+40](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
    Let's aim for that sweet spot of 20-200 [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)
    next time, okay?\n\n<!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points
    for this: +4 as a basis; -8 for too many hits-of-code (973 >= 200); -16 for way
    too many hits-of-code (973 >= 800); -4 for very few (4) comments; +28 to give
    you at least something. Please, [keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/eo, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-42](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). '

  greeting: |-
    Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your effort, but there are a few areas for improvement. Your submission of 659 hits-of-code exceeded our recommended limit, resulting in a deduction. Additionally, the lack of code review and only 2 comments impacted your points. However, we've adjusted the score to ensure you receive recognition for your work. Your final reward is +4 points, bringing your running balance to [+96](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). Please remember to keep your contributions [concise and focused](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html), and encourage code reviews for better collaboration. We look forward to your future contributions!

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -8 for too many hits-of-code (659 >= 200); -16 for the lack of code review; -4 for very few (2) comments; +28 to give you at least something. Please, [keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) them coming. Your running balance is [+96](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).  -->

    points, which is the minimum we can give. Here's the breakdown: +4 base points,
    -16 because there were no reviewer comments (we really value those!), and then
    +16 to keep you at the minimum. Remember, more [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html)
    and active code reviews can boost your points next time! [Keep](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)
    the contributions coming - we're excited to see what you'll do next. Your current
    balance is [+4](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).\n\n<!--
    Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis;

  branch: generate
  details: It's time to punish @Anatolay for the branch named as 'generate', which
    is wrong in objectionary/eo-phi-normalizer#511, the penalty amount is -12.
  greeting: |-
    As per our work policy, [naming Git branches](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html) like \"`generate`\" is not recommended and incurs a penalty. You've been deducted **12 points** for this violation. In the future, please name your branch after the ticket number you're working on, such as \"`510`\". This helps maintain consistency and improves project organization. Let's adhere to the guidelines to enhance our workflow efficiency.

    <!-- It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html) to name Git branches the way you named this one: "`generate`". You've earned -12 points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of the ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for example, would be "`510`".  -->

    Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your effort, but there are some concerns regarding the size of your code submission. Your contribution of 1436 hits-of-code exceeds our recommended limits, resulting in point deductions as per our policy. Despite this, you've earned 4 points: +4 base points, -8 for exceeding 200 hits-of-code, -16 for exceeding 800 hits-of-code, and +24 to ensure a minimum reward. Your current balance is [+20](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). For future contributions, please aim for smaller, more focused changes. We encourage you to [continue contributing](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) while keeping our guidelines in mind.

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -8 for too many hits-of-code (1436 >= 200); -16 for way too many hits-of-code (1436 >= 800); +24 to give you at least something.

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/eo, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).

  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/benchmark, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-40](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). '

  award: -12
  branch: new-rules
  details: It's time to punish @eyihluyc for the branch named as 'new-rules', which
    is wrong in objectionary/eo-phi-normalizer#523, the penalty amount is -12.
  greeting: "Hey team, let's aim for more descriptive branch names! \U0001F680 [Our
    guidelines](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html) suggest
    using ticket numbers, so instead of \\\"`new-rules`\\\", how about \\\"`522`\\\"?
    This helps us track progress better. Remember, clear naming earns points (-12
    this time, but no worries!). Let's make our next branches shine! \U0001F4A1\n\n<!--
    It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html)
    to name Git branches the way you named this one: \"`new-rules`\". You've earned
    -12 points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of
    the ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for example, would
    be \"`522`\".  -->"

  commit: b6950739319db948291f68e8d5c009f95579f123
  default_branch: master
  details: It's time to punish @yegor256 for pushing to the default branch 'master'
    in objectionary/eo, the penalty amount is -16.
  greeting: 'It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/07/21/read-only-master-branch.html)
    to push directly to the default branch `master`. You''ve earned -16 points. Next
    time, create a new branch, push your changes over there, then make a pull request
    and merge it. Even if you are flying solo, contributing via pull requests is a
    [good practice](https://www.yegor256.com/2020/07/29/open-source-etiquette.html).
    Your running balance is [-60](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). '

  greeting: |-
    Naming Git branches like \"`fix-pretty-printer`\" [isn't recommended](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html) and violates our work policy. As per our guidelines, you've incurred a **-12** point penalty. For future reference, please use the ticket number as the branch name. In this instance, \"`528`\" would have been the ideal choice. This practice ensures clarity and aligns with our project management standards.

    <!-- It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html) to name Git branches the way you named this one: "`fix-pretty-printer`". You've earned -12 points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of the ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for example, would be "`528`".  -->

  greeting: |-
    Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your effort, but there are some areas for improvement. Unfortunately, we can't award points due to the lack of code review and absence of reviewer comments. These are crucial aspects of our development process as outlined in our team policy. Your contribution earned +4 base points, but -16 for no code review and -16 for no reviewer comments. To ensure better outcomes in the future, please request code reviews and encourage reviewer feedback. We look forward to your continued contributions and improvements. Remember, [quality and speed](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) are both important in our work.

  greeting: |-
    Hello team member, I noticed that your branch name "`hack-new-rules`" doesn't follow our naming convention. As per our [policy](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html), branch names should match the ticket number you're working on. For example, "`554`" would be an ideal name in this case. Due to this, there's a deduction of 12 points. Your current balance is now [-8](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). Let's ensure we stick to the convention moving forward to maintain consistency in our project management. Keep up the good work!

    <!-- It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html) to name Git branches the way you named this one: "`hack-new-rules`". You've earned -12 points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of the ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for example, would be "`554`". Your running balance is [-8](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).  -->

    Thanks for your contribution! Here's how your +4 points were calculated: +4 base, -16 for no code review, -4 for only 1 comment, and +20 to meet the minimum 4-point reward. Remember, [code reviews](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html) and more comments can significantly boost your points next time. [Keep the contributions coming](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html)! Your current balance is [+32](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -16 for the lack of code review; -4 for very few (1) comments; +20 to give you at least something.

  greeting: |-
    Thank you for your contribution! Unfortunately, we couldn't award points this time due to policy violations: no code review was conducted (-16 points) and no comments were posted by reviewers (-16 points). These are crucial for maintaining code quality and fostering team collaboration. Despite these setbacks, we've ensured a minimum reward of 4 points. Your current balance is [+12](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). We encourage you to [keep contributing](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) and to engage actively in the review process for future submissions. Let's work together to improve our development practices!

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -16 for the lack of code review; -16 for absolutely no comments posted by reviewers; +32 to give you at least something.

    Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your effort, but there are some areas for improvement. Your submission of 251 hits-of-code exceeded our 200 limit, resulting in an 8-point deduction. Additionally, the lack of code review and comments from reviewers led to further deductions.

    Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your effort, but there are some areas for improvement. As per our policy, you've earned 4 base points. However, we had to deduct 16 points for the lack of code review and 16 points for no reviewer comments. Additionally, there's an 8-point deduction for the low number of [hits-of-code](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/11/14/hits-of-code.html) (4). To maintain our minimum reward, we've adjusted the total to +4 points. Your current balance is [+28](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). We encourage you to [continue contributing](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) while focusing on these areas for future submissions.

  branch: constant-objects
  details: It's time to punish @fizruk for the branch named as 'constant-objects',
    which is wrong in objectionary/eo-phi-normalizer#602, the penalty amount is -12.
  greeting: |-
    Hello team member, I noticed that the branch name "`constant-objects`" doesn't follow our [naming convention](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html). As per our policy, this results in a deduction of 12 points. In the future, please name your branches using the ticket number you're working on (e.g., "`601`"). This helps maintain consistency and clarity in our project management. Your current balance is now [-12](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). Let's work together to improve our branch naming practices moving forward.

    <!-- It is [not a good idea](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html) to name Git branches the way you named this one: "`constant-objects`". You've earned -12 points. Next time, better give your branch the same name as the number of the ticket that you are solving. In this case, a perfect name, for example, would be "`601`". Your running balance is [-12](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).  -->

  greeting: |-
    Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your effort, but there are a few areas for improvement. You've earned +4 points as a base, but we had to deduct 8 points for exceeding 200 hits-of-code (317), 16 points for lack of code review, and 4 points for insufficient comments (only 1). To ensure you receive some recognition, we've added 28 points, bringing your total to +4. Please remember to [keep your contributions smaller](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html) and encourage code reviews in the future. Your current balance stands at [+32](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html). We look forward to your continued participation and growth within the team.

    <!-- Thanks for the contribution! You've earned +4 points for this: +4 as a basis; -8 for too many hits-of-code (317 >= 200); -16 for the lack of code review; -4 for very few (1) comments; +28 to give you at least something.

    Thank you for your contribution! We appreciate your effort, but there are some areas for improvement. Unfortunately, we couldn't award points this time due to the lack of code review and absence of reviewer comments. In line with our [policy](https://www.yegor256.com/2018/03/06/speed-vs-quality.html), these oversights result in significant deductions. However, we've ensured a minimum reward of 4 points to recognize your effort. Your current balance stands at [+36](https://www.eolang.org/zerocracy/objectionary-vitals.html).
